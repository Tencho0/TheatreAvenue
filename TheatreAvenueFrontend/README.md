# TheatreAvenueFrontend

The TheatreAvenueFrontend is the user-facing component of the TheatreAvenue project, responsible for displaying information to the user and handling user interactions. It is built using React and communicates with the backend using HTTP requests. For the frontend, we use Husky for Git hooks, Yarn as the package manager, and Axios for HTTP requests.
