// Import the Card component from the '../Card/Card' module
import { Card } from '../Card/Card'

// Define a new React component called AverageCard that takes in an 'item' prop
export const AverageCard = ({ item }) => {
  // Render a div element with class names 'col-6 col-sm-4 col-lg-6'
  // Inside the div, render the Card component and pass the 'item' prop to it
  return (
    <div className="col-6 col-sm-4 col-lg-6">
      <Card item={item} />
    </div>
  )
}

//This code defines a React component called "AverageCard". The component takes in a prop called "item" and renders a div element with the class names "col-6 col-sm-4 col-lg-6". Inside the div, it renders another component called "Card" and passes the "item" prop to it.

//Assuming that the "../Card/Card" module exports a valid React component, this code is likely a part of a larger frontend application that uses the "AverageCard" component to display a card-like UI element. The "item" prop is likely used to populate the content of the card with specific data.

//The class names in the div element suggest that this component may be part of a larger grid system for layout purposes, with different column widths specified for different screen sizes.
